# How to contribute

## Getting started

So you're interested in contributing to DatoCMS External Audio Field? That's great! We're excited to hear your ideas and experiences.

This file describes all the different ways in which you can contribute.

## Reporting a bug

Have you encountered a bug while using this plugin? Please let us know by reporting it.

Before doing so, take a look at the existing [Issues](https://github.com/novemberfiveco/datocms-plugin-external-audio-field/issues) to make sure the bug you encountered hasn't already been reported by someone else. If so, we ask you to reply to the existing Issue rather than creating a new one. Bugs with many replies will obviously have a higher priority.

If the bug you encountered has not been reported yet, create a new Issue for it and make sure to label it as a 'bug'. To allow us to help you as efficiently as possible, always try to include the following:

- What version are you using?
- What browser are you using?
- What did go wrong?
- What did you expect to happen?
- Detailed steps to reproduce.

The maintainer of this repository monitors issues on a regular basis and will respond to your bug report as soon as possible.

## Contributing code

Would you prefer to contribute directly by writing some code yourself? That's great.

**If your contribution is minor**, such as fixing a bug or typo, we encourage you to open a pull request right away.

**If your contribution is major**, such as a new feature or a breaking change, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

The workflow for creating a pull request:

1. `fork` the repository.
2. `clone` your forked repository.
3. Create a new feature branch from the `master` branch.
4. Make your contributions to the project's code. Please keep the code style conform to the project's style guide (listed below).
5. Add documentation where required. Please keep the style conform
6. `commit` your changes in logical chunks.
7. `push` your branch to your fork on GitHub.
8. Create a pull request from your feature branch to the the original repository's `master` branch.

The maintainer of this repository monitors pull requests on a regular basis and will respond as soon as possible. The smaller individual pull requests are, the faster the maintainer will be able to respond.

## Style guide

When contributing code, please try to follow the code style of the existing codebase to keep everything consistent. It is much easier to understand a codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.
